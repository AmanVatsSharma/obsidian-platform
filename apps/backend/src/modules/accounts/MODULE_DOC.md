JWT required; Tenant header enforced; RBAC permissions: accounts:read|write, ledger:read|write, statements:read

## Error Handling
Uses AppError and GlobalHttpExceptionFilter.

## Concurrency & Idempotency
Per-account advisory locks; unique externalRefId for idempotent postings.

## Buying Power Rules
Moved to OMS module. Accounts now queries OMS `RiskConfigService` for multipliers and margin rates.

## EOD Statements
IST by default; per-account timezone preference to be respected later.
